# HREE PBPK Modeling in R

This repository provides scripts for physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling focused on the intravenous injection and oral administration of heavy rare earth(HREE) chlorides, including gadolinium (Gd), yttrium (Y), dysprosium (Dy), and terbium (Tb). The models are implemented in R and simulate the distribution and excretion of these compounds across various tissues.

## Scripts Overview

rat.R: PBPK model for rats.
mice.R: PBPK model for mice, with parameters derived from rats using allometric scaling.
Human.R: PBPK model for humans, with parameters adjusted for human body weight.
The models simulate both intravenous injection and oral administration scenarios, supporting analysis of heavy rare earth elements under different exposure pathways.

## Documentation

For detailed usage instructions, parameter settings, and explanations, please refer to the file Code_Explanation.docx (or Code_Explanation.pdf if converted). This document provides step-by-step guidance for running and interpreting the models.
